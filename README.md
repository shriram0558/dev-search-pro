# DevSearchPro

DevSearchPro is a comprehensive job aggregation tool designed to streamline the job search process. It programmatically scrapes data from various career pages, consolidating numerous job postings into a single, easy-to-navigate interface.

One of the unique features of DevSearchPro is its ability to accept custom links to career pages. This means you can apply your own filters on the career pages, paste the URL into our tool, and get a customized list of job postings that match your specific criteria.

This project aims to make job hunting more efficient by providing a centralized platform for viewing and filtering job postings from multiple sources.

## Development Status

Please note that DevSearchPro is currently under development. While functional, it may still be subject to changes and improvements. We welcome any feedback or contributions to the project.
